### Description

The course Practical Introduction to Neural Networks is a project-based graduate course aimed to provide practical and fundamental skills to perform research with neural networks.

We will survey the fundamentals of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and describe the underlying principles making neural networks generic computing frameworks. We will then build computational skills for training neural networks, understanding and working with algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adam, Dropout, Initialization, etc, and different types of ANNs, such as Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, GANs. The course will conclude with projects developing ANN systems to provide efficient solutions to applications.
